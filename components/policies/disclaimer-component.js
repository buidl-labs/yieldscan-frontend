		<h1 id="4-investment-risks">4. Investment risks</h1>
		<p>
			The investment in cryptocurrencies can lead to loss of money over short or
			even long periods. The investors in cryptocurrencies should expect prices
			to have large range fluctuations. The information published on the Website
			cannot guarantee that the investors in cryptocurrencies would not lose
			money.
		</p>
		<h3 id="protocol-specific-risks">Protocol specific risks</h3>
		<p>
			Each decentralized network has it&#39;s own protocol, where each protocol
			might be different from the rest. By participating in these protocols you
			might expose yourself to several protocol specific risks, including but
			not limited to, slashing/loss of funds, burning of unclaimed rewards,
			locking of tokens for some time period or failure of the protocol itself.
			You act at your own risk when participating in any such protocol. In no
			way are the owners of, or contributors to, the Website responsible for
			mitigating such risks.

			in cryptocurrencies occurs within their respective decentralized networks,
			and not on the Website.
